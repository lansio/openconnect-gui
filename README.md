### Install

1. Open the DMG file
2. Drag "OpenConnect VPN" to your Applications folder
3. **Important**: Remove quarantine attribute (app is unsigned)

### ⚠️ First Launch - Bypass Security Warning

macOS will show **"OpenConnect VPN is damaged"** because the app is not code-signed.

**Choose one method:**

**Method 1: Terminal (Recommended)**
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/OpenConnect VPN.app"
```
Then launch the app normally from Applications.

**Method 2: Right-Click**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on "OpenConnect VPN" in Applications
2. Click "Open"
3. Click "Open" again in the security dialog

**You only need to do this once.** Subsequent launches will work normally.

### Required Dependencies

The app will verify these on first launch:

- ✅ **OpenConnect** - VPN client (install with `brew install openconnect`)
- ✅ **expect** - Terminal automation (pre-installed on macOS)
- ✅ **Sudo access** - Required for VPN connections

## Prerequisites (Development)

The app currently builds unsigned. Users will need to right-click → Open on first launch.

## Usage

### Application Interface

The application features a clean tab-based interface:

1. **Connection** - VPN connection settings and recent activity
2. **Logs** - Complete connection history and debugging information
3. **Diagnostics** - Network troubleshooting and route management
4. **Processes** - View running OpenConnect processes

### Connecting to a VPN

#### From the Connection Tab:

1. **Enter Connection Details:**

   - Server URL (e.g., `https://vpn.example.com:443`)
   - Username
   - Password
   - Protocol (AnyConnect, GlobalProtect, Fortinet, etc.)
   - Auth Group (optional)
   - Server Certificate Pin (optional, format: `pin-sha256:...`)

2. **Click Connect**

   - You'll be prompted for your macOS administrator password
   - OpenConnect requires sudo privileges to create VPN connections

3. **Monitor Connection**
   - Status badge changes: "Disconnected" → "Connecting" → "Connected"
   - IP address updates automatically in the header (before/after connection)
   - Recent activity shows the last 10 log entries on the right
   - Click "View All Logs" to see complete connection history

### Saving Profiles

1. Fill in the connection form
2. Enter a **Profile Name**
3. Click **Save Profile**

**Security Note:** Passwords can be securely stored in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux secret-service) instead of plaintext JSON. When you save a profile with a password, the app will store it in your system's secure keychain and only save a reference to it locally. The password field will appear empty in saved profiles when using keychain.

### Using Saved Profiles

1. Select a profile from the dropdown menu
2. If using keychain, the password will be automatically loaded from your system keychain
3. Click **Connect**

**Note:** If you need to update credentials, re-enter the password and click Save Profile to update it in both the local file and system keychain.

### Deleting Profiles

1. Select a profile from the dropdown
2. Click the trash icon (🗑️) next to the dropdown

### Using Network Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** tab helps troubleshoot VPN connection issues:

**Features:**

- **VPN Server Connectivity** - Test if your server is reachable
- **Network Interfaces** - View active network adapters and IPs
- **Route Detection** - Automatically identifies problematic network routes
- **Route Deletion** - Remove stale routes that block connections

**Common Scenario:**
If you recently switched networks (e.g., from mobile hotspot to WiFi), you may have stale routes. The diagnostics tab will highlight these in red with a "Delete" button.

**To Delete a Route:**

1. Navigate to the Diagnostics tab
2. Problematic routes are highlighted in red
3. Click "Delete" on the problematic route
4. Enter your sudo password in the modal
5. Route is removed and diagnostics refresh automatically

### Monitoring Processes

The **Processes** tab shows all OpenConnect processes:

**What it shows:**

- Processes started by this application
- Processes started manually via terminal
- Processes started by other VPN tools

**How to use:**

1. Click the Processes tab
2. Processes load automatically on first visit
3. Click "Refresh" to update the list
4. Badge in navigation shows count of active processes

**Killing Processes:**

1. Click the "Kill" button next to any process
2. Enter your sudo password in the modal
3. Process is forcefully terminated with SIGKILL (-9)
4. Process list automatically refreshes

⚠️ **Warning**: Killing processes forcefully terminates VPN connections and may result in data loss.

### Viewing Connection Logs

The **Logs** tab provides comprehensive connection history:

**Features:**

- All OpenConnect output in real-time
- Expect script messages prefixed with `[EXPECT]`
- Error messages prefixed with `[ERROR]`
- Debug information prefixed with `[DEBUG]`
- Copy all logs to clipboard with "Copy" button
- Clear logs with "Clear" button

**Recent Activity (Connection Tab):**

- Shows last 10 log entries
- Quick view while managing connections
- Click "View All Logs" to jump to Logs tab

## How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Main Process** (`main.js`):

   - Manages Electron application lifecycle
   - Performs startup system checks (OpenConnect, expect, sudo access)
   - Spawns OpenConnect via expect script for proper PTY handling
   - Handles IPC communication with React renderer
   - Manages system tray integration
   - Stores/loads connection profiles to `~/Library/Application Support`

2. **Expect Script** (`vpn-connect.exp`):

   - Creates proper pseudo-terminal (PTY) for OpenConnect
   - Handles interactive sudo password prompt
   - Sends VPN username and password at correct prompts
   - Detects authentication failures and timeouts
   - Keeps connection alive after establishment

3. **Preload Script** (`preload.js`):

   - Secure IPC bridge using context isolation
   - Exposes whitelisted APIs: `connectVPN`, `disconnectVPN`, `getStatus`, etc.
   - Event listeners for status changes and log messages

4. **React Frontend** (`src/`):
   - Modern component-based UI with shadcn/ui and tab navigation
   - Real-time status updates and connection logs
   - Profile management (save/load/delete)
   - IP address monitoring (fetches from ipify.org)
   - Network diagnostics with route detection and management
   - Process monitoring (shows all running OpenConnect instances)
   - Contextual help and usage guides
   - Dark mode support

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials and clicks Connect
2. App prompts for sudo password (macOS dialog)
3. Expect script spawns `sudo openconnect` with credentials
4. Script detects and handles prompts:
   - Sudo password → Sends sudo password
   - Username prompt → Sends VPN username
   - Password prompt → Sends VPN password
5. Connection established or error reported
6. IP address refreshed to show new VPN IP

### Network Diagnostics Flow

1. User navigates to Diagnostics tab (lazy loads on first visit)
2. App fetches network information:
   - Routing table (`netstat -rn`)
   - Network interfaces (`ifconfig`)
   - VPN server connectivity test (`nc -zv`)
3. Routes are analyzed for problems:
   - Gateway IPs that don't match current network interfaces
   - Routes pointing to unreachable private networks
   - Stale routes from previous VPN connections or network changes
4. Problematic routes highlighted in red with "Delete" button
5. User clicks "Delete" → Modal prompts for sudo password
6. Route deleted via `sudo route delete <destination>`
7. Diagnostics automatically refresh to show updated routes

## Security Considerations

- ✅ **Context Isolation** - Renderer can't access Node.js directly
- ✅ **IPC Whitelisting** - Only approved APIs exposed
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All user inputs validated before use in system commands
- ✅ **Command Injection Prevention** - PID, route destinations, and network parameters strictly validated
- ✅ **Sudo Authentication** - Passwords passed securely via stdin, user prompted each time
- ✅ **Proper PTY** - Expect script prevents credential leakage in logs
- ✅ **Safe Command Execution** - Uses `spawn()` with argument arrays instead of shell string interpolation
- 🔐 **System Keychain Integration** - Secure password and 2FA code storage using macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux secret-service
- ✅ **Optional Password Encryption** - Choose whether to store passwords in system keychain

## Troubleshooting

### System Check Failures

The app performs startup checks for:

- **OpenConnect** - Install with `brew install openconnect`
- **expect** - Should be pre-installed at `/usr/bin/expect`
- **Sudo access** - User must be in admin group

### Connection Issues

**"Incorrect sudo password" error:**

- Verify you're entering your macOS login password
- Check logs for `[EXPECT ERROR]` messages

**"VPN authentication failed":**

- Verify VPN username and password
- Check server URL format (e.g., `https://vpn.example.com:443`)
- Confirm server certificate pin if using `--servercert`

**"Failed to connect" or "Can't assign requested address":**

- This is often caused by stale network routes
- Go to the **Diagnostics** tab
- Look for routes highlighted in red (problematic routes)
- Click "Delete" on problematic routes and enter your sudo password
- Common example: Route to `172.20.10.1` when you're not on that network anymore

**Connection succeeds but no internet:**

- Check logs for vpnc-script errors
- Route configuration may have failed but tunnel is established
- Use the Diagnostics tab to verify your routes
- Try manual route: `sudo route add -net 0.0.0.0/0 <gateway>`

**"expect script not found" in production:**

- The DMG build should include vpn-connect.exp in extraResources
- Check: `/Applications/OpenConnect VPN.app/Contents/Resources/vpn-connect.exp`

### Stale VPN Processes

If the **Processes** tab shows unexpected OpenConnect processes:

**Option 1: Via App UI (Recommended)**

1. Go to the **Processes** tab
2. Click the **Kill** button next to the process you want to terminate
3. Enter your sudo password in the modal
4. Process will be forcefully terminated and list will refresh

**Option 2: Via Terminal**

```bash
# View all OpenConnect processes
ps aux | grep openconnect | grep -v grep

# Kill specific process by PID
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Or kill all OpenConnect processes
sudo pkill -9 openconnect
```

**Option 3: System Monitor**

- Open Activity Monitor
- Search for "openconnect"
- Force quit the process

### App Won't Open on macOS

**"OpenConnect VPN is damaged" error:**

- App is not code-signed
- Right-click → Open (first launch only)
- Or: `xattr -cr "/Applications/OpenConnect VPN.app"`

## Data Storage

Connection profiles are stored in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/openconnect-gui/profiles.json
```

This file contains usernames, passwords, and server information in plaintext. Protect this file accordingly.

## Development

### Debug Mode

To open the developer tools:

- macOS: `Cmd + Option + I`
- Or add `mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();` to `main.js`

### Logs

Application logs from the main process are visible in the terminal where you ran `npm start`.

## Known Limitations

- ⚠️ **Password Storage** - Passwords stored in plaintext JSON
- ⚠️ **macOS Only** - Designed for macOS (expect script, sudo dialogs)
- ⚠️ **Unsigned App** - Requires right-click → Open on first launch
- ⚠️ **Username/Password Only** - Certificate auth not yet supported
